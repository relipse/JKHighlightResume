This is my second PHP powered resume, see it in action here: https://cworklog.com/cv
The idea was to take my 3-page resume and fit it all on one page using highlights from my experiences.
When using Chrome if you right click -> Print, it should show all on one page.

If you are talented with CSS, you can modify the styles to suit your needs.
Thanks
